## 📝 About This Repository

This portfolio includes projects that cover:

- **Basic C# concepts**: variables, loops, conditions, and methods.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: classes, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.
- **Collections & LINQ**: arrays, lists, dictionaries, and LINQ queries.
- **Generics & Type Safety**: creating reusable and type-safe code.
- **Delegates & Lambda Expressions**: exploring functional programming concepts.
- **Algorithms & Mathematics**: prime numbers, Fibonacci, geometry calculations.
- **Error Handling & Validation**: exceptions, input validation.
- **Advanced Features**: multithreading, reflection, extension methods.
- **Mini-Applications**: console-based games, media players, and management systems.

Each project is a **standalone console application**. You can run them individually and explore their features.
